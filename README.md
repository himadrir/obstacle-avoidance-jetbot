# obstactle-avoidance-jetbot
Demonstration of Jetbot to do obstacle avoidance
Using Sparkfun Jetson Nano Robot kit 
Using binary classification data is classified into blocked and not blocked
Weights are assigned to the classified dataset
The bot was trained using 250 images to define blocked and not blocked environment
As the robot determines if the path is blocked it takes a left turn else proceeds onto its path

***IMPROVEMNTS THAT CAN BE MADE***
Whenever the bot detects a obstacle(blocked) it turns right, further improvement can be made to the logic of the bot avoiding the obstacle(determining if going left or right would be better rather than just turning left)
